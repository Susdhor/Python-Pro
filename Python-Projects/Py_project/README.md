# Hotel Data Analysis using Python

Welcome to the Hotel Data Analysis project! This project involves analyzing hotel data, with a special focus on converting PDF files to text and using regular expressions for data extraction and processing.

## Project Description

In this project, we analyze data from hotel records stored in PDF format. The main steps include:

1. **PDF to Text Conversion**: Extracting text data from PDF files.
2. **Data Cleaning and Extraction**: Using regular expressions (regex) to clean and extract relevant data from the text.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing various analyses on the cleaned data to derive insights.

## Setup

To get started with this project, you will need to set up your Python environment with the required libraries. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-data-analysis.git
    cd hotel-data-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the analysis:

1. **PDF to Text Conversion**:
    - Place your PDF files in the `data/pdfs` directory.
    - Run the PDF to text conversion script:
        ```sh
        python scripts/pdf_to_text.py
        ```
    - This will generate text files in the `data/texts` directory.

2. **Data Cleaning and Extraction**:
    - Use the regex script to clean and extract data:
        ```sh
        python scripts/clean_and_extract.py
        ```
    - This script will process the text files and produce cleaned data in a structured format.

3. **Data Analysis**:
    - Run the analysis script to perform various analyses on the cleaned data:
        ```sh
        python scripts/analyze_data.py
        ```
    - The results will be saved in the `results` directory.
