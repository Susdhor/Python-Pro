# Amazon Fine Food Reviews Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of Amazon Fine Food Reviews using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and the RoBERTa pre-trained model. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis, basic NLTK operations, utilize the RoBERTa model for comparison, and pipeline the process to review both positive and negative 5-star reviews.

## Project Objectives
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
   - Identify patterns and trends within the data.

2. **Basic NLTK Operations**:
   - Utilize NLTK for text processing tasks such as tokenization and stemming.
   - Preprocess the text data and extract relevant information.

3. **RoBERTa Model Comparison**:
   - Integrate the RoBERTa pre-trained model to compare its performance with NLTK methods.
   - Leverage advanced language understanding capabilities for deeper insights.

4. **Review Pipeline**:
   - Design and implement a pipeline to process and review both positive and negative 5-star reviews.
   - Automate the analysis workflow for efficiency.

## Detailed Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Explore review scores distribution and review length.
   - Visualize insights using charts and graphs.

2. **Basic NLTK Operations**:
   - Tokenize and stem the text data.
   - Calculate word frequencies and perform sentiment analysis.

3. **RoBERTa Model Comparison**:
   - Encode and analyze text data using the RoBERTa model.
   - Compare results with NLTK methods.

4. **Review Pipeline**:
   - Develop a systematic pipeline for processing reviews.
   - Automate repetitive tasks.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into Amazon Fine Food Reviews using advanced NLP techniques. The developed pipeline enables efficient analysis and interpretation of customer sentiments, facilitating data-driven decisions for businesses.
